# Kick Off

Run the preamble to detect project configuration and environment:

```bash
source <(~/.claude/skills/koji/bin/koji-detect)

# --- Version check ---
KOJI_VERSION=$(cat "$KOJI_SKILLS/VERSION" 2>/dev/null | tr -d '[:space:]')
KOJI_REMOTE_VERSION=$(curl -sf --max-time 3 "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BruhGreg/koji/main/VERSION" 2>/dev/null | tr -d '[:space:]')

echo "=== koji kick-off ==="
echo "Project: $PROJECT_NAME"
echo "koji: v$KOJI_VERSION"

# Version comparison
if [ -n "$KOJI_REMOTE_VERSION" ] && [ "$KOJI_VERSION" != "$KOJI_REMOTE_VERSION" ]; then
  echo "UPDATE_AVAILABLE: v$KOJI_VERSION → v$KOJI_REMOTE_VERSION"
else
  echo "koji: up to date"
fi

echo "Has session log: $HAS_SESSION_LOG"
echo "Has handoff: $HAS_HANDOFF"
echo "Has lessons: $HAS_LESSONS"

# --- Detect gstack ---
if [ -d "$HOME/.claude/skills/gstack" ] && [ -f "$HOME/.claude/skills/gstack/VERSION" ]; then
  GSTACK_VERSION=$(cat "$HOME/.claude/skills/gstack/VERSION" 2>/dev/null | tr -d '[:space:]')
  echo "gstack: v$GSTACK_VERSION (available)"
  echo "HAS_GSTACK=true"
else
  echo "gstack: not installed"
  echo "HAS_GSTACK=false"
fi
```

If `HAS_SESSION_LOG` is `false` or `HAS_HANDOFF` is `false`, tell the user to run `/koji-init` first and stop.

## Workflow

### 0a. Migration check (docs/ → .koji/)

Run the migration detection script:

```bash
source <(~/.claude/skills/koji/bin/koji-migrate-check)
echo "Needs migration: $KOJI_NEEDS_MIGRATION"
echo "Legacy files: $KOJI_LEGACY_FILES"
```

If `KOJI_NEEDS_MIGRATION` is `true`, tell the user:

> Found koji files in legacy location: $KOJI_LEGACY_FILES
> Your `.koji.yaml` points to `.koji/`.
>
> 1. **Migrate** — move files to `.koji/` and update references
> 2. **Skip** — keep them in `docs/` (update `.koji.yaml` to match)

If **Migrate**: create `.koji/`, move each file from `docs/` to `.koji/`, move `docs/sessions/` to `.koji/sessions/` if present, update `CLAUDE.md` and agent config references, re-run koji-detect.
If **Skip**: patch `.koji.yaml` to `docs_dir: docs`, continue normally.
If `KOJI_NEEDS_MIGRATION` is `false`, skip silently.

### 0b. Version check

If the preamble shows `UPDATE_AVAILABLE`:

Use AskUserQuestion:

> koji update available: v{old} → v{new}

Options:
- A) Update now — pulls latest and re-runs setup (~2 seconds)
- B) Skip this time
- C) Always update — auto-update on every kick-off

If A: run `cd ~/.claude/skills/koji && git pull origin main && ./setup` then continue.
If C: run `koji-config set auto_update true` then update.
If B: continue without updating.

If `koji-config get auto_update` returns `true` and an update is available, update silently without asking — just show: `koji updated: v{old} → v{new}`.

### 1. Check for user-provided focus

If the user typed text after `/kick-off` (e.g., `/kick-off build the news landing page`), use that as the **session focus** — skip reading the last session's starter prompt and use the user's intent instead. Still read handoff and lessons for context.

If no args provided, proceed to step 2.

### 2. Read context (always)

Read these files and internalize the content — do NOT dump them back to the user:

1. `$DOCS_PATH/AI_HANDOFF.md` — current project state, roadmap, decisions, blockers
2. `$DOCS_PATH/lessons.md` — recent corrections and gotchas (focus on the top 10 entries)
3. `$DOCS_PATH/agent-session.md` — read the **last** session entry for continuity (what was done, notes for next session)

### 3. Brief the user

Output a concise briefing (not a wall of text):

> **Session start — $PROJECT_NAME**
>
> Last session: [1-line summary of what was done]
> Handoff says: [1-line summary of the most important next task]
> Watching out for: [1-line gotcha from lessons, if relevant — otherwise skip]
>
> **Focus:** [user's arg if provided, OR the "Notes for Next Session" from the last entry]

### 4. Suggest gstack workflows (only if gstack detected)

If `HAS_GSTACK` is `true`, analyze the current dev phase from the handoff and session log, then suggest **2-3 relevant gstack skills** — not all of them, just what makes sense right now.

**Phase detection heuristics:**

- **Planning/early stage** (handoff has mostly unchecked items, few completed):
  - Suggest: `/office-hours` (brainstorm), `/plan-eng-review` (lock architecture)

- **Active development** (in-progress items, recent code changes):
  - Suggest: `/investigate` (if debugging), `/browse` (if frontend), `/design-review` (if UI work)

- **Pre-ship** (feature complete, needs polish/review):
  - Suggest: `/qa` (test + fix), `/review` (pre-landing diff review), `/ship` (create PR)

- **Post-ship** (just deployed or merged):
  - Suggest: `/canary` (monitor production), `/document-release` (update docs)

- **Security/infrastructure work**:
  - Suggest: `/cso` (security audit), `/careful` (safety guardrails)

Format as a short suggestion, not a menu:

> **gstack:** Looks like active frontend work — `/browse` to preview, `/design-review` for visual polish, or `/qa` when ready to test.

If gstack is not detected, skip this step entirely — no output.

### 5. Ready
